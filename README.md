App for distributing activities between persons.

Specialized for preschool with houses and classes like Harry Potter.

Activies may include something like "climbing" or "drawing" but can be defined as anything you want.

The purpose of this application is to distribute the activities between the entered persons fairly.
For that the persons have to select preferences per weekday on which they are present. An Algorithm then distributes the activities via a scoring system.
This works essentially like this:
1. the list of persons gets mixed randomly
2. in order of the mixed list the persons get distributed to the activities as long as these have room.
If they dont have room left the second choice is taken and so on
Depending on the choice they got, so if it was their first, second... choice they get a higher score.
3. for the next weekday the persons get sorted depending on the score they got the day before. So people with a higher score are further in the line to get their choice for the weekday.

The Algorithm gets more fair, the more weekdays are present. Meaning, that if there are only one or two weekdays, where there are activities, the distribution is more random.
